# mkwav.c

`mkwav.c` is a trivial c program which tacks an RIFF 16 bit .wav
header to any arbitrary input file.  In other words, it lets you
listen to arbitrary data on your PC speakers.  For what it's worth.

## Installation

Do something like `cc mkwav.c -o mkwav.exe` to compile it and then try
running it without any arguments for usage information.
